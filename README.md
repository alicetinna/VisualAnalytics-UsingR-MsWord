# VisualAnalytics-UsingR-MsWord
The aim of this project was to  create charts, infographics, or any other data representation. I have created the first project on the Percentage liking of my favorite things throughout the day.
I am sharing my day's most liked activities (Morning, After Noon, and Evening), for that, I have created the Visualizations, (Radar Charts/Spider Charts) using R studios. And added little icons using 3-D Models from Microsoft Word.
Here I have given the range from (0-10), 0 being the lowest 0%, while 10 being the highest 100%. In between, I have given ranges of 30%, 50%, and 70%. Like in the morning I love to pet my Dog, Gabbar. My morning is never completed without him. Then we both go to see the sunrise and I take my tea with me, then we will go for walk, long walks. 
I love to listen to Music, in Morning the most around 90%, I do not sleep in the afternoon so it's 0% and a lot of my Information.
